## Debugging/Initial stage

Tested the transmitter (on the left of breadboard) and the reciever (on the right of breadboard) sections. The RC car is made using ASK transmitter and reciever modules (433MHz carrier). The transmitter section is built using a transmitter and an encoder (HT12E). The reciever section is built using a reciever, a decoder (HT12D), a motor driver IC (half-H driver) (L293D) and a not gate (7404).
